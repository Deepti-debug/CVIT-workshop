# CVIT-workshop
This repo comprises the learnings of a 1-week long learning-by-doing sessions held at CVIT-workshop (Centre for Visual Information Technology, IIIT-H, India). <br /> These structured sessions presented me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of various DIP (Digital Image Processing) techniques by coding up corresponding implementations.

## Week-1 Learnings:
### Session 1:
    Implementations of:
    - Data structures e.g., *int*, *string*, *boolean*, *list*, *tuple*, *dict*
    - Conditional statements e.g., *if-else* and *loops*.
    - Functions and File operations
    - Simple image manipulations via:
        - OpenCV, Numpy and matplotlib libraries
        - Histograms and thresholding
        - Chroma Keying

### Session 2:
    - Implementation of simple morphological operations on image like dilation, erosion, closing, etc.
    - Applied the aforementioned learnings to build a **Barcode Detection and Scanning System** via traditional image processing techniques.
