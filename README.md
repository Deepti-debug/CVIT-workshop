# CVIT-workshop
This repo comprises the learnings of a 1-week long learning-by-doing sessions held at CVIT-workshop. <br /> These structured sessions presented me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of various DIP (Digital Image Processing) techniques by coding up corresponding implementations.

## Week 1 Learnings:
Implementations of:
- Data structures e.g., *int*, *string*, *boolean*, *list*, *tuple*, *dict*
- Conditional statements e.g., *if-else* and *loops*.
- Functions and File operation
- Numpy and matplotlib
- Histograms
- Image manipulation techniques via *cv2*
- Barcode reader via traditional image processing techniques
